# Remote Filesystem and Kernel Management with Dockerized Servers

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on managing remote filesystems and kernels using Dockerized servers. The project leverages NFS (Network File System) and TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to facilitate seamless booting and file management for embedded systems, including STM32 and Raspberry Pi boards.

## Key Features
- **Dockerized NFS and TFTP Servers:** Simplified setup and deployment of NFS and TFTP services within Docker containers, ensuring portability and ease of management.
- **Remote Filesystem Management:** Efficient handling of remote filesystems, enabling embedded devices to mount root filesystems over a network.
- **Remote Kernel Loading:** Streamlined process for loading and booting kernels from a remote server using TFTP.
- **Extensibility:** Potential for further enhancement to integrate with online repositories and CI/CD pipelines, making the system more robust and scalable.

## Status
This project is a work in progress. Additional features and documentation will be added as development continues.
